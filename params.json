If you already use devkitArm then you are good to go\r\n\r\nJust run `make` (or `make all`/`make build`) to get your binaries in the build directory\r\n\r\n`build 3ds`, `build 3dsx` and `build cia` are also available in case not all binaries need to be built.\r\n\r\nYou can also use `make clean` to remove all built files.\r\n## Nightlies\r\nNightlies are available at [the official automatic Nightly build page](https://hikiruka.github.io/Yuki-FM/build/) and build whenever changes get pushed to the `master` branch\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n* Rinnegatamante for Lua Player Plus, [lpp-3ds](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds) and ORGANIZE3D as it uses some (mostly) of his code\r\n* ihavemac for YAFM As it utulizes some of his code\r\n* astronautlevel2 for the proper updating screen as used in [Star Updater](https://github.com/astronautlevel2/StarUpdater)\r\n* Wolvan for the nightlies\r\n",
